    "text": "Stephen Curry became unstoppable and famous at Davidson College after leading the team in a Cinderella run to the Elite Eight in 2008. After being drafted 7th overall by the Golden State Warriors in 2009, then he ended up transforming the game with his deep shooting and ball handling movements. Curry is a 3-time NBA Champion and 2-time MVP making him the first unanimous MVP in league history. He has become the name and face of the Warriors more than a decade into his career. As he has aged 16 years the question remains, is he still playing at an elite level showing longevity?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nrookie &lt;- tibble(\n  stat = c(\"Points per Game\", \"3PA per Game\", \"3P%\", \"Usage Rate\", \"Assists\", \"FG%\"),\n  rookie = c(6.6, 4.8, 43.7, 21.2, 5.9, 46.2),\n  current = c(8.7, 11.8, 40.8, 31.6, 5.1, 45.0)\n)\n\nggplot(rookie, aes(x = rookie, xend = current, y = stat)) +\n  geom_dumbbell(color = \"black\",\n                size = 3,\n                colour_x = \"blue\",\n                colour_xend = \"yellow\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Longevity of a Legend\",\n    subtitle = \"Rookie is &lt;span style='color:blue;'&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; and Current is &lt;span style='color:yellow;'&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt; \",\n    caption = \"By: Natalia Guerrera\\nSource: Sports Reference\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size = 12)   \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 21, we see his scoring and passing ability are clear indicators of the impact he was going to have in the future. As he reached 37 his usage rate remains high, the way he impacts the game shifts. He maintains his scoring, his three-point attempts have increased significantly and he is still extremely accurate. We see Curry’s adaptation which further has extended his prime.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n\nrookie &lt;- c(`FG%` = 46, `3P%` = 44, `FT%` = 89)\ncurrent &lt;- c(`FG%` = 45, `3P%` = 41, `FT%` = 92)\n\n\nrookie_waffle &lt;- waffle(rookie, rows = 10, \n                        colors = c(\"red\", \"orange\", \"darkgreen\"),\n                        title = \"Young Sharpshooter\")\n\ncurrent_waffle &lt;- waffle(current, rows = 10, \n                         colors = c(\"red\", \"orange\", \"darkgreen\"),\n                         title = \"2023–24 Season\") +\n   labs(title = \"More Shots, Still Sharp\",\n       subtitle = \"2023-24\",\n       x = \"Stat\",\n       y = NULL,\n       caption = \n       \n       \n       \"By: Natalia Guerrera \n       Source: Sports Reference\")\n\n\nrookie_waffle + current_waffle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese percentages show how he has been so consistent and not declining. Curry’s three-point accuracy dipped slightly when doubling his attempts, and his free-throw percentage improved a tribute to his work ethic and discipline.\n\n\nCode\ncurry_scatter &lt;- tibble(\n  Season = c(\"Rookie\", \"2023–24\"),\n  Attempts = c(380, 800),\n  Percent = c(43.7, 40.8)\n)\n\nggplot(curry_scatter, aes(x = Attempts, y = Percent, color = Season)) +\n  geom_point(size = 5) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = Season),\n            nudge_y = c(0.6, -0.6),\n            fontface = \"bold\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Steph Curry: 3PA vs. 3P%\",\n    x = \"3-Point Attempts\",\n    y = \"3-Point Percentage (%)\",\n    color = \"Season\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(35, 47)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurry attempted fewer than 400 threes but knocked them down at 43.7% in his rookie season. Now, this past season he attempted just under 800 threes, but still maintained an impressive 40.8% accuracy.\nThis proves that efficiency does not have to drop off with increased usage, proving further Steph is and always will be an elite player.\nSo… how has Curry’s playing styling evolved as he aged? While he is not his same youthful self even after aging 16 years he is still a dominant force in the NBA. His long range shooting as inspired so many other players to improve their shooting depth. The unique shots and plays he creates makes him hard to defend. Stephen Curry’s sustained elite performance over 16 years is a testament to his exceptional skill, unwavering work ethic, and intelligent evolution as a player. He is not just an elite player of the past; he remains an elite player in the present, showcasing remarkable longevity at the highest level of the game."
