    "text": "Stephen Curry became unstoppable and famous at Davidson College after leading the team in a Cinderella run to the Elite Eight in 2008. After being drafted 7th overall by the Golden State Warriors in 2009, then he ended up transforming the game with his deep shooting and ball handling movements. Curry is a 3-time NBA Champion and 2-time MVP making him the first unanimous MVP in league history. He has become the name and face of the Warriors more than a decade into his career. As he has aged 16 years the question remains, is he still playing at an elite level showing longevity?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nrookie &lt;- tibble(\n  stat = c(\"Points per Game\", \"3PA per Game\", \"3P%\", \"Usage Rate\", \"Assists\", \"FG%\"),\n  rookie = c(6.6, 4.8, 43.7, 21.2, 5.9, 46.2),\n  current = c(8.7, 11.8, 40.8, 31.6, 5.1, 45.0)\n)\n\nggplot(rookie, aes(x = rookie, xend = current, y = stat)) +\n  geom_dumbbell(color = \"black\",\n                size = 3,\n                colour_x = \"blue\",\n                colour_xend = \"yellow\") +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Longevity of a Legend\",\n    subtitle = \"Even at 37, Steph Curry continues to break the mold of aging in basketball.&lt;br&gt;\n                Rookie is &lt;span style='color:blue;'&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; and Current is &lt;span style='color:yellow;'&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;\",\n    x = \"Rate Statistic\",\n    y = NULL,\n    caption = \"By Natalia Guerrera | Source: Sports Reference\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_markdown(size = 12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 21, we see his scoring and passing ability are clear indicators of the impact he was going to have in the future. As he reached 37 his usage rate remains high, the way he impacts the game shifts. He maintains his scoring, his three-point attempts have increased significantly and he is still extremely accurate. We see Curry’s adaptation which further has extended his prime.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n\nrookie &lt;- c(`FG%` = 46, `3P%` = 44, `FT%` = 89)\ncurrent &lt;- c(`FG%` = 45, `3P%` = 41, `FT%` = 92)\n\n\nrookie_waffle &lt;- waffle(rookie, rows = 10, \n                        colors = c(\"red\", \"orange\", \"darkgreen\"),\n                        title = \"Young Sharpshooter\")\n\ncurrent_waffle &lt;- waffle(current, rows = 10, \n                         colors = c(\"red\", \"orange\", \"darkgreen\"),\n                         title = \"2023–24 Season\") +\n   labs(title = \"More Shots, Still Sharp\",\n       subtitle = \"2023-24\",\n       x = \"Stat\",\n       y = NULL,\n       caption = \n       \n       \n       \"By: Natalia Guerrera \n       Source: Sports Reference\")\n\n\nrookie_waffle + current_waffle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese percentages show how he has been so consistent and not declining. Curry’s three-point accuracy dipped slightly when doubling his attempts, and his free-throw percentage improved a tribute to his work ethic and discipline.\n\n\nCode\ncurry_scatter &lt;- tibble(\n  Season = c(\"Rookie\", \"Current\"),\n  Attempts = c(380, 800),\n  Percent = c(43.7, 40.8)\n)\n\nggplot(curry_scatter, aes(x = Attempts, y = Percent, color = Season)) +\n  geom_point(size = 5) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = Season),\n            nudge_y = c(0.6, -0.6),\n            fontface = \"bold\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Steph Curry: 3PA vs. 3P%\",\n    x = \"3-Point Attempts\",\n    y = \"3-Point Percentage (%)\",\n    color = \"Season\",\n    caption = \"By: Natalia Guerrera\\nSource: Sports Reference\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(35, 47)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurry attempted fewer than 400 threes but knocked them down at 43.7% in his rookie season. Now, this past season he attempted just under 800 threes, but still maintained an impressive 40.8% accuracy.\nThis proves that efficiency does not have to drop off with increased usage, proving further Steph is and always will be an elite player.\nSo… how has Curry’s playing styling evolved as he aged? While he is not his same youthful self even after aging 16 years he is still a dominant force in the NBA. His long range shooting as inspired so many other players to improve their shooting depth. The unique shots and plays he creates makes him hard to defend. Stephen Curry’s sustained elite performance over 16 years is a testament to his exceptional skill, unwavering work ethic, and intelligent evolution as a player. He is not just an elite player of the past; he remains an elite player in the present, showcasing remarkable longevity at the highest level of the game."

    "text": "The Miami Dolphins continue through their seasons known for their home-field advantage with the Florida heat. With blazing temperatures and clear skies, they looked unstoppable early on—putting up huge yardage and dominating opponents at home. But as the season cooled down, so did their production. The team that seemed untouchable in the sun began to struggle in colder weather conditions. As the playoffs loomed, a new question surfaced: were the Dolphins actually a bad weather fraud?\n\n\nCode\nweather_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  Week = 1:18,\n  Temperature = c(91,87,66,87,64,NA,66,83,51,64,82,77,27,78,80,75,61,31),\n  Weather = c(\"Clear\", \"Clear\", \"Clear\", \"Clear\", \"Cloudy\", NA, \"Clear\", \"Cloudy\", \"Cloudy\", \"Clear\", \"Overcast\", \"Clear\", \"Overcast\", \"Cloudy\", \"Cloudy\", \"Clear\", \"Rain\", \"Clear\"),\n  Q1 = c(0,7,3,0,3,NA,7,10,3,7,7,0,0,6,0,3,3,6),\n  Q2 = c(7,3,0,3,0,NA,3,3,7,3,3,24,3,9,6,10,3,0),\n  Q3 = c(7,0,0,3,6,NA,0,7,3,7,7,7,8,0,6,6,7,0),\n  Q4 = c(6,0,0,6,6,NA,0,7,14,6,17,3,6,11,0,10,7,14)\n)\n\nweather_data &lt;- subset(weather_data, !is.na(Temperature))\n\nweather_data$Weather_Type &lt;- ifelse(\n  weather_data$Temperature &gt; 55 & !(weather_data$Weather %in% c(\"Rain\", \"Overcast\", \"Snow\")),\n  \"Good\", \"Bad\"\n)\n\nweather_types &lt;- unique(weather_data$Weather_Type)\nquarters &lt;- c(\"Q1\", \"Q2\", \"Q3\", \"Q4\")\navg_list &lt;- list()\n\nfor (wt in weather_types) {\n  subset_data &lt;- weather_data[weather_data$Weather_Type == wt, ]\n  avg_points &lt;- colMeans(subset_data[, quarters], na.rm = TRUE)\n  avg_list[[wt]] &lt;- data.frame(\n    Quarter = quarters,\n    Average_Points = avg_points,\n    Weather_Type = wt\n  )\n}\n\nquarterly_averages &lt;- do.call(rbind, avg_list)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(quarterly_averages, aes(x = Quarter, y = Average_Points, group = Weather_Type, color = Weather_Type)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Heating Up or Cooling Off?\",\n       subtitle = \"How weather conditions influence scoring consistency throughout the game.\",\n       x = \"Quarter\",\n       y = \"Average Points\",\n       caption = \"By Natalia Guerrera | Source: Sports Reference\",\n       color = \"Weather Type\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line graph illustrates how weather impacts scoring by quarter. In good weather, teams score steadily across all four quarters, with noticeable peaks in the second. In contrast, bad weather suppresses scoring in the early quarters. Interestingly, there’s a spike in the fourth quarter during bad weather games—suggesting late-game urgency or defensive fatigue may influence outcomes despite poor conditions.\n\n\nCode\ncold_weather_summary &lt;- data.frame(\n  Temperature_Range = c(\"≤ 40°F\", \"≤ 23°F\"),\n  Wins = c(0, 3),\n  Losses = c(11, 7)\n)\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\ncold_weather_long &lt;- pivot_longer(cold_weather_summary, cols = c(\"Wins\", \"Losses\"),\n                                   names_to = \"Result\", values_to = \"Games\")\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(cold_weather_long, aes(x = Temperature_Range, y = Games, fill = Result)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Wins\" = \"#008E97\", \"Losses\" = \"#FC4C02\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Freezing the Fins: Miami’s Cold-Weather Curse\",\n       subtitle = \"A look at how the Dolphins perform when temperatures \ndrop below comfort zone.\",\n       x = \"Temperature at Kickoff\",\n       y = \"Number of Games\",\n      caption = \"By Natalia Guerrera | Source: Sports Reference\",\n       fill = \"Game Result\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph highlights Tua Tagovailoa struggles in cold weather, particularly when temperatures dip below 40°F. The Dolphins have yet to win a game in these freezing conditions (0–11) and fare only slightly better when it’s extremely cold (≤ 23°F), with 3 wins and 7 losses. The data reinforces that Miami’s performance drops significantly as the thermometer does.\n\n\nCode\nweather &lt;- c(\"Heat\", \"Cold\")\n\noffense_yards &lt;- c(4701, 2121)\ndefense_yards &lt;- c(3239, 1926)\npoints_scored &lt;- c(372, 124)\npoints_allowed &lt;- c(209, 182)\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2), oma = c(4, 0, 2, 0), mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2), cex.main = 0.9, cex.lab = 0.8, cex.axis = 0.8)\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2), oma = c(5, 0, 0, 0)) \n\n\n# Barplot 1: Yards\nbarplot(\n  rbind(offense_yards, defense_yards),\n  beside = TRUE,\n  col = c(\"steelblue\", \"firebrick\"),\n  names.arg = weather,\n  ylim = c(0, max(offense_yards) + 500),\n  main = \"Yard Work: Miami’s Production \nin Heat vs Cold\",\n  ylab = \"Yards\",\n  cex.names = 0.8\n)\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"Offense\", \"Defense Allowed\"), fill = c(\"steelblue\", \"firebrick\"), cex = 0.7)\n\n# Barplot 2: Points\nbarplot(\n  rbind(points_scored, points_allowed),\n  beside = TRUE,\n  col = c(\"darkgreen\", \"orange\"),\n  names.arg = weather,\n  ylim = c(0, max(points_scored) + 50),\n  main = \"Scoring Freeze: Points For and \nAgainst by Weather\",\n  ylab = \"Points\",\n  cex.names = 0.8\n)\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"Points Scored\", \"Points Allowed\"), fill = c(\"darkgreen\", \"orange\"), cex = 0.7)\n\n# Shared footnote\nmtext(\"Note: Heat = &gt;60°F | Cold = ≤60°F\", side = 1, outer = TRUE, line = 2, cex = 0.8)\nmtext(\"By: Natalia Guerrera | Source: Sports Reference\", \n      side = 1, outer = TRUE, line = 4, cex = 0.8, font = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows that the Miami offense performs significantly better in warm weather, gaining more yards and scoring more points compared to cold conditions. Meanwhile, their defense allows slightly fewer yards in cold games but gives up nearly the same number of points. Overall, the data suggests that Miami struggles offensively in colder weather, highlighting a difference in performance based on temperature.\nThe Miami Dolphins struggle significantly in cold weather, both in terms of game outcomes and offensive production. The stacked bar charts show sharp declines in yards gained and points scored in colder conditions, while defensive performance remains relatively steady—suggesting that offensive struggles are the primary issue. The win-loss chart further confirms this, with Miami winning almost no games in temperatures at or below 40°F. The line graph showed an interesting twist that scoring tends to spike in the fourth quarter even in bad weather, possibly due to late-game pressure or adjustments.\nAltogether, the data supports the claim that cold weather hurts Miami’s overall performance, especially offensively. The consistent trends across this data support that Miami’s reputation for underperforming in the cold is the truth."
